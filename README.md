opendevice-hardware-libraries
=============================

This library is responsible for communication using the API and protocols supported by OpenDevice.

To install the library, you can simply clone the repository e copy the arduino/OpenDevice  to /libraries folder of your Arduino folder. Or you can also download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it in the /libraries folder.

Please note that the library also requires some other libraries to function properly, when used with other connection types or sensors, like the library for the Enc28j60 chip.

For now, the implementations were ported to Arduino and Energia.
